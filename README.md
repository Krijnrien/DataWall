## DataWall 2017 Testing

### Project setup
1. Make sure you clone the project in your ```src``` folder in your ````GOPATH````. If you don't , the project won't be 
able to link the different packages properly. 
If you don't know where your ```GOPATH``` is, 
open a terminal and run ```go env``` and search for ```GOPATH```.

1. Now install all dependencies by going to the root of the repository and running ```go get .```.
